	<h2 style="color: orange;text-align: center">Welcome to trekking club</h2>
	<p>
<b>
The Trekking Club Program at Indian institute of Information Technology is comprised of trekking 
clubs formed, developed, governed, and administered by the 
student membership working in 
conjunction with the Office of Intramurals and Recreation, a unit of the Division of Student 
Life.
The key to the success of this program is student leadership, interest, involvement, and 
participation. The Trekking Club Council
with advisement of the Office of Intramurals and 
Recreation has created this manual in order to provide officers with the structural framework 
necessary for clubs to gain recognition, develop leadership skills, and run safe, efficient 
programs.
The policies and procedures contained herein apply to all of the clubs. Trekking club members, 
officers, and the faculty/staff advisor are required to read, understand, and follow the 
procedures outlined in this manual. Questions regarding the policies and procedures within this 
manual should be directed to the 
Mentor
of Intramurals and Recreation or the Trekking Club.

<h4 style="color: red;">Objectives</h4> <br>

* Developing an understanding of the natural world has always been a key 
  component of TREK. Students are provided with direct experiences that 
  enable them to integrate their learning into the wider world and make
  personal connections.

* Emphasizing hands-on, real-world learning experiences, this approach to 
  education [place-based learning] increases academic achievement, helps students
  develop stronger ties to their community, enhances students appreciation for the
  natural world, and creates a heightened commitment to serving as active
  contributing citizens.

<h3 style="color: red;">Outcomes</h3>
* Wildlife encounters

  Does the idea of walking in remote wilderness as wombats cross the  
  trail ahead, wedge tailed eagles fly above and padmelons hop around the
  campsite as the sun sets in the distance appeal to you? We don’t blame you! 
  This is one of the many wildlife scenarios that trekkers encounter on the 
  Overland Track in Tasmania, where a visit into the wilderness also equates 
  to a visit into the wildlife homeland! Wildlife and bird watching is one of
  the many highlights while on a trek, and can give a unique insight into the
  ecosystems of a destination.
* Softer skill development

  The benefits of trekking don’t just apply to your physical, mental or social
  health – it can also benefit your management skills, believe it or not! ,
  When planning your trek, you may find yourself setting training targets, 
  planning for the trek, organising your schedule, setting goals, learning 
  how to adapt to change and developing your mental strength. These are all 
  skills that are highly valued in the working world, and can be a foundation 
  for personal growth that you may surprise you with a newfounded self confidence!
* Reduces Stress

  It’s hard to argue with science. A study in the The Proceedings of the National
  Acadamy of Science found that that “exposure to nature can counteract the negative
  effects of stress and anxiety: Those who completed the nature walk tended toward less
  rumination—the acute focus on one’s distress—than those who took the urban route”. 
  Spending time outdoors on a trek or active holiday in nature is a perfect way to cleanse
  your mind from the stress and worries from home. Trekking often requires a person to be
  focussed on their activity, where the only distractions are majestic vistas and dramatic scenery.
  Ask any trekker and they’ll attest that spending time in the wilderness was one of the most
  relaxing times they’ve had.

<h3 style="color: red;">About</h3>

<pre>

* Trekking is about walking in the hills and camping. Carrying all 
  your requirements like food, clothes and shelter with you as you
  move along a trail.

* It is one of the ways to visit places which offer great panoramic 
  views and pleasant environs. The places which one can visit only 
  by walking, since there are no roads up to these places. It brings 
  one closer to the nature and brings the best out of an individual.
  For a complete answer one has to go on a trek or camp to find out the
  joys and advantages of going to the wild.

*  One can certainly do trekking all alone. But for this you must have
   sufficient knowledge of all aspects of trekking and survival. However,
   it is advisable to do trekking in group to take care of all the eventualities
   one may encounter during the outing in the wild.

<h3 style="color: red;"> PLACES WORTH VISITING BEFORE YOU DIE</h3> <br><br>
<h4 style="color: red;"> @Singalila Kanchenjunga Trek </h4>
<pre>
 The Singalila Trek is the most admired trek in Sikkim to bring the trekkers
 at the foot of Mt. Kanchenjunga. The Singalila Trek in Sikkim covers the 
 political boundary of Nepal and Sikkim and brings the ancient Himalayan Kingdom
 of Tibetan culture. The trek that brings the breath-taking views of the Himalayan
 range in spite of the presence of some barren landscape; being devoid of any trees
 and boasts of rocky hills but still the charm and the placid atmosphere is the 
 adequate reason to captivate tremendous trekkers all around the valleys.

 The folds and grassy meadow of Singalila adds delight to trekking
 at Singalila to bring a blissful environment. The presence of
 astounding lakes all around the Singalila region add a perfect charm
 to the ambience of trekking in Sikkim.

<h4 style="color: red;"> @Zanskar Frozen River Trek </h4>
<pre>

 Walking on the ice-covered river of Zanskar is an ultimate experience 
 for adventure freaks that are keen to do trekking in the Indian Himalayas.
 This trek is also named as Chadar trek, which means blanket. Spring water
 prevents this icy blanket from completely smothering the river, which in
 some places, retains its rapids; all the more awesome in temperature of 
 -25 to –30 degrees. The trek goes by shuffling along the Chadar that breaks
 and changes color on the river every few hours! A magnificent and at times
 challenging trek, with opportunities to relish ancient Buddhist monasteries
 and secluded villages nestled in the depths of the deep gorges valley of
 Trans Zanskar ranges. At places, the Chadar (ice sheet) does not form over the river.

 Then, the trekkers have to forge a new trail trekking over snow-covered banks
 to move down to a spot on the Zanskar river, where the ice is more stable.
 What sets this trek apart is its matchless experience. Everything about it is
 exceptional: the panorama, atmosphere, the frozen river, caves, unusual campsites,
 sledges and the ever changing Chadar.

<h4 style="color: red;"> @Mandani Bugyal  </h4>
<pre>

 For some, a sword and sorcery teaming with ancient lyricism, while for others
 a fabulous tale of good over evil, Mahabharata is a triumph when it comes to narratives.
 If ever given an award for the most incredible tale ever told – then the story of 
 the Mahabharata would be the sure shot winner. It is so extraordinary that it has made
 numerous people speculate – ‘Did it really happen? Well, there are many places in India
 that have yielded archaeological evidence and have been identified as ancient cities 
 described in the Mahabharata. 

 One unique place that this blog will bring to your notice is Mandani Bugyal,
 which is approximately 35 kilometers from Ranshi village in Kedarnath Valley.
 And a trekkers paradise too. Hardly known to people, and largely neglected by the authorities,
 Mandani Bugyal too has a history that dates back to Pandavas and said to have been
 crossed by them before their final ascent to Swargarohini.
