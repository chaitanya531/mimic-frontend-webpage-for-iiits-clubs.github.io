	<h2 style="color: orange;text-align: center">Welcome to sports club</h2>
	<p>

The Sport Club Program at Indian institute of Information Technology is comprised of sport 
clubs formed, developed, governed, and administered by the 
student membership working in 
conjunction with the Office of Intramurals and Recreation, a unit of the Division of Student 
Life.
The key to the success of this program is student leadership, interest, involvement, and 
participation. The Sport Club Council
with advisement of the Office of Intramurals and 
Recreation has created this manual in order to provide officers with the structural framework 
necessary for clubs to gain recognition, develop leadership skills, and run safe, efficient 
programs.
The policies and procedures contained herein apply to all of the clubs. Sport club members, 
officers, coaches, and the faculty/staff advisor are required to read, understand, and follow the 
procedures outlined in this manual. Questions regarding the policies and procedures within this 
manual should be directed to the 
Mentor
of Intramurals and Recreation or the Sport Club.

<h3 style="color:red">About</h3>

<p>

Sport (British English) or sports (American English) includes all forms 
of competitive physical activity or games which,through casual or organised 
participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while
providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for 
spectators.Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting
to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game. others provide tie-breaking
methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests
may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an
annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some
cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or
competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants
may compete, each against each other, with one winner.

</p>



<p>



Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical
athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the
Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations 
such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a 
physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive,
but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic
Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, 
and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five
non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and
limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.
